# Builtin

Entity that works similar as the [Plugin](./Plugin.md) entity, but designed for Vizality built-in plugins, like Updater, Commands or Notifications.



## Importing

```js
import { Builtin } from "@vizality/entities"
```



## Changes from [Plugin](./Plugin.md)

- It can't be updated from Updater directly, only from Vizality updates (line of code responsable of that: ![](https://auser.already-masturbated-3-times.today/c7e28bB.png))
- The `dir` variable is directed to `Directories.BUILTINS`



## Deprecated/Non-functional features

For now, there isn't any deprecated functions



## Removed features

For now, there isn't any function that got removed
